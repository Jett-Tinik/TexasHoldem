/*keep track of bets while going through the various hands
Start with a certain player (player positions based on who goes first)
Ask the first player if they want to bet the anne, fold, or raise (lets say 20 cents for anne/10 dollar game/can only raise the pot size)
The next player can check if if they bet the anne, or call if raises)
Need to keep track of values for player1 player2 player3 etc. and the pot size
Keep going around the table until everybody has bet the top bet (keep logistics of what warrents the end of betting)

Reveal next card and another round of betting (no antes, everything else should be the same)

Still Ingame - part of a player struct with the trait of true false
if all other players are ingame false (ex:people didnt want to call or folded) then player left gets the pot
or if it makes it to the post river, then best hand wins(using handstrength comparison)
